# Project Name
Ping Pong with Numbers

## Features
This program will take any whole, positive integer inputted and count up from 0 to the number. When it reaches multiples of 3, it will substitute the word "ping" for the number; for numbers divisible by 5, it will substitute "pong"; and for numbers divisible by 15, it will substitue "pingpong".

1. When counting, for numbers inputted that are not divisible by 3, 5, or 15, print out the numbers. 
  * Input: 2
  * Output: 1, 2

2. When counting, for numbers inputted that are divisible by 3, print out "ping" instead.
  * Input: 3
  * Output: 1, 2, "ping"

3. When counting, for numbers inputted that are divisible by 5, print out "pong" instead.
  * Input: 5
  * Output: 1, 2, "ping", 4, "pong"

4. When counting, for numbers inputted that are divisible by 15, print out "pingpong" instead.
  * Input: 15
  * Output: 1, 2, "ping", 4, "pong", 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, "pingpong"
